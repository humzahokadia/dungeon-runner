# dungeon runner
This a 3D-Platform runner game where you fight monsters and collect power ups to excel in the levels

About Project:

This game was the final project for my game development class. The project was a group project and each member was assigned a different task. My task was to desing,create and spawn in different powerups using c# scripts. I was also responsible for adding powerupt scripts to the player to allow the player to use the abilities of each powerup along with creating the prebuilt levels. I also assited the other team members in their tasks such as scripts player movement scripts, enemy prefab creations and enemy movement/power scripts.

View Scripts and Materials:

If you open the assets folder each part of the game will be stored in its own folder. Each folder will contain materials, scripts, prefabs and more.
eg. Enemies folder will contain all materials,scripts and prefabs for all enemies.
