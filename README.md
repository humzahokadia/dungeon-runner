# dungeon runner
 This a 3D-Platform runner game where you fight monsters and collect power ups to excel in the levels

This game was the final project for my game development class. The project was a group project and each member was assigned a different task. My task was to desing,create and spawn in different powerups using c# scripts. I was also responsible for adding powerupt scripts to the player to allow the player to use the abilities of each powerup along with creating the prebuilt levels. I also assited the other team members in their tasks such as scripts player movement scripts, enemy prefab creations and enemy movement/power scripts.

There is an mac only version of the game added above
enjoy
